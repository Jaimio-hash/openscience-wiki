# Files, artifacts, and versions

Keep the original file, uploaded copy and generated artifact distinct. This page covers ownership, finding files and saved revisions. See [Previews](previews.md) for viewing controls and [Sessions](sessions.md) for export bundles.

<PlatformGuide />

## Attach an input or reference a folder

Use **Composer → + → Attach files**, select `GSE60450_Lactation-GenewiseCounts.txt`, wait for the attachment chip, and preview it before sending. The display name remains recognizable; the managed input path can include a checksum suffix. Removing a chip cancels its inclusion in the draft, not the original file on disk. **Your files** selects an existing project file instead of uploading it again.

A folder reference is useful when several inputs should remain on disk. In **Files → Filter project files → This computer → Add folder…**, navigate to a specific subfolder and choose **Read-only** or **Read & write**. Review the kernel-stop confirmation before **Grant this folder**. Changing Notebook file access stops active kernels so their permissions can be recreated. Cancel leaves the proposed grant unapplied. Folder selection and permissions are detailed in [Projects](projects.md).

| Local file control | Action and resulting state |
| --- | --- |
| Directory path | Enter a permitted directory, then navigate to it |
| Go to parent directory | Move up one directory within the browser's access rules |
| Go to | Choose a saved location |
| Refresh directory | Reload the directory listing |
| Pin this folder | Add/remove a location shortcut; removing it does not delete the folder |
| File row | Open the file in a preview |
| Reload file | Reread the external file after it changes |
| More actions → Copy path | Copy the external file path |
| More actions → Save as artifact | Save a managed project copy; wait for Saved |
| Download | Save an external copy through the platform's save flow |

A read-only grant protects the external directory while still allowing outputs inside the project workspace. Use the local-file controls above to refresh sources and save managed copies.

<PlatformContent platform="windows">

For an existing folder, open **Files**, select the **Artifacts** dropdown, then **This computer → Add folder…**. In the app’s **Grant folder access** dialog, choose a specific subfolder and **Read-only**, then **Grant this folder**. The user-profile root may be unavailable; select the research subfolder instead. Read any Notebook-kernel impact confirmation. On returning to Files, verify the selected folder and its files.

In the Windows **Attach files** dialog, select a file from a path containing Chinese characters or spaces, or enter its full path in the **File name** field and open it. Back in the app, check the attachment name and preview the table dimensions and contents. To abandon a selection, choose **Cancel** and check that no new attachment was added to the draft.

## Find inputs and generated results

1. Open **Files** and select **Filter project files → All artifacts**.
2. Read **Your uploads** separately from **Generated files** grouped by session.
3. Select **List view** for names and sizes, or **Grid view** for visual cards.
4. Enter a filename fragment in **Search project files**, such as `rnaseq`. Check the matching names and owning sessions.
5. Clear the search to show files excluded by that filter.
6. **Expand files** opens the larger library; **Exit full screen files** returns to the workspace.

<PlatformContent platform="macos">

</PlatformContent>
The count describes the current filter. A search with no matches does not delete files. **No more** means the group has finished loading. Collapse a group by its heading. Use a file body's preview action for a modal, or **Open … in split view beside the session** to retain the conversation beside it. Download acts on the file/version selected by that surface.

### Return to a local folder and save a reading copy

1. Open **Files → Filter project files → This computer** and enter the permitted source directory in **Directory path**.
2. Select **Pin this folder**. Navigate elsewhere, then **Go to → Pinned** to return. **Remove bookmark**, or the pinned row's **Unpin**, removes the shortcut only.
3. Choose **Refresh directory** to see newly added filenames. For an already open file changed outside the app, use **Reload file** to reread its contents.
4. In the local preview, choose **More actions → Save as artifact** and wait for **Saved**.
5. Return to **All artifacts → Your uploads** and reopen the saved copy. It has managed version controls and no local-source path in the header.

Reopen the managed copy and compare its content with the local source. Later source changes do not update the saved copy automatically. Use the version-conflict steps below when editing managed content.

## Edit a report and compare versions

<p className="example-label"><strong>Worked example</strong> Add a reading note and compare report revisions</p>

Open a supported managed text or Markdown file. The example below adds a reading note to an existing report; saving creates a new revision without changing the original input or rerunning its analysis.

1. Open the managed Markdown file and select **Edit rnaseq-qc-report.md**.
2. Edit the source field. Keep the existing method and provenance text.
3. Select **Save changes**. The header advances from **v1** to **v2**.
4. Select **Compare … with its source version**. Added text appears in the difference view.
5. Use **Stop comparing** to return to the rendered report.
6. Select **Previous file version** to inspect v1, then **Next file version** to return to v2.

| Editing control/state | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Save changes disabled | Make a valid change; unchanged text has nothing to save |
| Cancel | Discard the current edit draft |
| Version arrows disabled | No older/newer version exists in that direction |
| Compare disabled | No supported source-version comparison is available |
| Save conflict | Reload the current version and reconcile your change; do not assume your draft overwrote another writer |
| Edit absent | This file type or source is not editable in that viewer; do not expect binary files or the CSV table to become spreadsheet editors |

Supported managed text/code and Markdown files can expose editing. The demonstrated CSV remained a read-only table; images and other binary formats do not acquire text editing through this feature. A manual edit creates a file revision; it does not rerun the Notebook or create a model review. Refer to [Notebook evidence](notebook.md) before citing a version's production history.

### Resolve a save conflict without losing either edit

If another writer saves the report while your editor remains open, **Save changes** can return **This file has a newer version. View latest version**. Your draft has not replaced that newer version.

1. Preserve your unsaved text before changing views.
2. Select **View latest version**. If **Discard unsaved changes?** appears, cancel until you have retained the changes you need.
3. Open the latest saved report and inspect the other writer’s additions.
4. Select **Edit**, reapply your changes to that latest text and save.
5. Reopen the result and use the version arrows to inspect earlier revisions.

<PlatformContent platform="macos">

![Save blocked because another version exists](/img/open-science/local-todo-batch/37-file-save-conflict.png)

</PlatformContent>
After saving, confirm that the latest revision contains both the other writer’s change and your retained draft. Earlier file revisions remain available through the version controls; these are separate from conversation-message revisions.

To rerun a captured result and compare its output, use [Reproducibility](reproducibility.md). For a portable copy of the conversation branches, files and evidence, use a [.science research package](research-packages.md).

## Export without losing the research record

Use the file's **Download** to save one result. Session **Download all artifacts** saves the chosen files to a folder; project **Download artifacts…** creates a ZIP with separate `generated` and `uploads` paths. Both expose selection controls. Read its scope, filenames and destination before confirming. Conversation **Export** is a transcript operation, distinct from downloading research files. See [Sessions](sessions.md) for the exercised selections and reopened downloads. A downloaded copy does not carry the complete live application state, credentials or external inputs.

Keep the original count matrix, the CSV, figure and methods report together for reuse. The [data workflow](../workflows/data-quality.md) provides the tested files and exact acceptance values. If a download fails, check destination permission and free disk space, then retry; a partial external file does not change the saved managed version.

### Open a downloaded report

Select the report version and choose **Download**. Open the saved `.md` file in a text editor and check its headings, paragraphs and data. Return to the app preview for the formatted report.

<PlatformContent platform="windows">

Open the downloaded `.md` file in Notepad. Notepad displays Markdown source: heading markers such as `##` and backticks are formatting characters. Check the headings, paragraphs and table contents. Return to the app preview to read the formatted report.

</PlatformContent>

### Preserve the selected file through copies and exports

When copying a message with managed references, paste it into the intended conversation and inspect each resulting attachment/reference before sending. A readable filename is not sufficient: open the reference and confirm its current owner and version.

Before exporting selected artifacts or a bundle, confirm the complete selection, wait for the outcome and reopen the downloaded files. If an edit, refresh or export fails, preserve the draft and source version while checking the actual saved result. A failed refresh does not establish that a preceding save failed.

If an attachment reports **Managed file or its Session is deleted**, reattach the intended current input through the app and inspect its ownership; see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
