# Explore tools

Choose a tool by the result you need: retrieve a record, inspect a file, execute a calculation or connect an external service. The application combines these capabilities, but they have different setup and evidence requirements.

## Choose a tool family

| Need | Start here | What must be ready | What to inspect afterward |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read files, plan work, calculate or publish results | [Built-in research tools](./built-in.md) | Accessible project input and operation permissions | Tool response, output file and execution record |
| Find which scientific software a method uses | [Scientific tool catalog](./catalog.md) | Check packages/weights separately from Skill installation | Actual executable/import and version |
| Run Python, R or a scientific workload | [Scientific tools](./scientific.md) | Selected runtime, packages or Compute Host | Code, errors, output checks and provenance |
| Query biomedical/scientific records | [Scientific databases](./databases.md) | Enabled Connector, network and any required credentials | Source IDs, returned fields and truncation |
| Inspect CSV, TSV or spreadsheet data | [Tables and datasets](./tables.md) | Supported file and current input | Visible rows/columns, delimiter and full-data dimensions |
| Read papers, sequences, structures and other outputs | [Scientific viewers](./viewers.md) | Supported format | Rendered content and any preview limitation |
| Connect an MCP server | [Connectors and MCP](./mcp.md) | Server configuration and trust | Connected state and a real tool response |
| Configure a service identity/key | [Service credentials](./credentials.md) | Correct service and usable account | Validation result or a bounded live query |
| Expose your own local data through a tool | [Custom MCP tool](./custom.md) | A working server with an input schema | Discovery, successful call and actual failure behavior |

## Availability has several meanings

**Listed** means the application knows a resource. **Enabled** means the selected agent may use it. **Connected** confirms a Connector session, but does not prove that a particular query is valid. **Executed** means a tool actually returned a result or error. **Verified** means that result was inspected against the task.

The local examples include real GSE60450 RNA-seq counts, a custom read-only QC server, an aspirin molecule artifact and public sequence/structure inputs. They use English application screenshots in both language editions. Remote GPU/SSH execution and credentials unavailable on this device remain explicitly distinguished from completed local operations.

## Give the agent a bounded request

Specify the source, operation and expected output. For a database query, include the identifier namespace and a small result limit. For a computation, name the input, selected language and checks. Ask for the actual error if the tool cannot run; an answer reconstructed from model memory is not a successful tool call.

A [Skill](../skills/overview.md) supplies the method; a [Specialist](../specialists/overview.md) supplies a reusable role. Neither automatically installs software, provides credentials or makes an inaccessible file available.
