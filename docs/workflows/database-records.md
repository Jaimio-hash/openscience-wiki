# Retrieve structured records from a scientific database

<p className="example-label"><strong>Worked example</strong> Seven straight-chain carboxylic acids in PubChem</p>

Start with compound names and finish with a table of verified identifiers and properties. This example retrieves acetic acid through octanoic acid, a seven-member homologous series with two to eight carbon atoms. The source records remain available alongside the table so that you can check how each value was obtained.

## 1. Define the compounds and properties

In **Settings → Connectors**, make sure **Chemistry** is available. Open a project, start a conversation and select a connected model. This run used Open-Science 0.30.1 and the Chemistry/PubChem Connector; it did not require an input spreadsheet.

Specify **neutral, straight-chain, saturated monocarboxylic acids**. A similar name can refer to a branched isomer, a salt or a conjugate base. A formula alone cannot distinguish all those structures.

```text
Use the Chemistry/PubChem Connector to retrieve acetic acid,
propanoic acid, butanoic acid, pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid,
heptanoic acid and octanoic acid. Resolve each name to a PubChem CID.
Retrieve molecular formula, molecular weight, the returned SMILES
and ConnectivitySMILES fields, InChIKey and the PubChem source URL.
Use neutral straight-chain acids, not branched isomers or salts.
Save pubchem-homologs.csv, pubchem-homologs-source.json and
pubchem-homologs-notes.md. Preserve exact lookup inputs and raw
responses. Check seven distinct CIDs, carbon counts 2–8, formulas
CnH2nO2, neutral charge and linear structures. Reopen the files.
Keep all outputs in English and do not delegate.
```

## 2. Check the actual database calls

After sending, expand the tool activity or open **Notebook**. The run resolved seven names with `pubchem_search_compounds`, then retrieved their records with `pubchem_get_compounds`. Inspect the returned CID and structure for each name before accepting the row. If a name returns several plausible identities, resolve that ambiguity first.

The example used exact acid names and the first returned CID, then checked the batch properties. This is suitable for these unambiguous names; taking the first hit is not a general identification rule.

## 3. Open the saved table

Wait until the response completes and the files appear under **Generated**. Open **pubchem-homologs.csv** and enlarge its preview. This run produced **7 rows · 8 columns**.

| Compound | PubChem CID | Formula | Molecular weight, g/mol |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| Acetic acid | 176 | C2H4O2 | 60.05 |
| Propanoic acid | 1032 | C3H6O2 | 74.08 |
| Butanoic acid | 264 | C4H8O2 | 88.11 |
| Pentanoic acid | 7991 | C5H10O2 | 102.13 |
| Hexanoic acid | 8892 | C6H12O2 | 116.16 |
| Heptanoic acid | 8094 | C7H14O2 | 130.18 |
| Octanoic acid | 379 | C8H16O2 | 144.21 |

Match rows by **CID**, not their display order. Check the formula and linear SMILES together. The example retains both returned field names, `SMILES` and `ConnectivitySMILES`; their strings happen to match for these compounds. Do not rename one as a different identifier or infer experimental stereochemistry from it.

## 4. Keep the source records with the export

Open **pubchem-homologs-source.json** to inspect all eight operations, exact lookup inputs and raw responses. Open **pubchem-homologs-notes.md** for the procedure and checks. The saved CSV was compared with the raw records; the seven identities, formulas and linear structures agreed.

Use the preview's **Download** button to keep a local copy. For this completed run, download the <ExampleDownload path="/examples/workflow-extensions/pubchem-homologs.csv">CSV</ExampleDownload>, <ExampleDownload path="/examples/workflow-extensions/pubchem-homologs-source.json">source records</ExampleDownload> and <ExampleDownload path="/examples/workflow-extensions/pubchem-homologs-notes.md">notes</ExampleDownload>. PubChem records can change; retain the source snapshot with your analysis.

These are database-computed or standardized properties, not new experimental measurements. Molecular weight is not exact monoisotopic mass, and this table does not establish purity, toxicity or biological activity. To compare conflicting source records, continue with [scientific record cross-checking](cross-check-records.md).
